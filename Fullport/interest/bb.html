    <h3>I loved playing and still play basketball since my school days.</h3>
    <p>In order to forget how bad of a day it was, playing basketball has always solved it. Although I am short 
    and I probably am not suited to play basketball I have still got the skills needed to be a proper team player 
    I did participate in a competition held during our sports week at college. I was able to acheive the 2nd place 
    because I was a pretty good team player and I was able to get a proper co-ordination with them.</p>
