    <h2>I love playing Mobile Legends</h2>
    <p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a mobile <br>
         multiplayer online battle arena game <br>
          developed and published by Moonton, <br>
          a subsidiary of ByteDance. Released in 2016, <br>
          the game grew in popularity worldwide,<br>
           most prominently in Southeast Asia,<br>
            and has since crossed 1 billion downloads,<br>
             with peak monthly players of 100 million.<br>
             At its core, the game pits 2 teams <br>
             of 5 against each other in real time with at least 10-second <br>
           matchmaking and 10-minute matches.<br>
            Featuring traditional battle arena gameplay,
             players must fight over three lanes to take the 
              enemy's tower and defend their own. Like classic MOBAs,<br>
               there is no hero training to level up<br>
               or pay to play angleâ€”winners and losers are decided based on skill,
             ability, and strategy.</p>
